|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[SuggestionsViewOptions](suggestionsviewoptions.md) <br/> |Contains the options for obtaining meeting suggestion information.  <br/> The following is the XPath to this element:  <br/>  `/GetUserAvailabilityRequest/SuggestionViewOptions` <br/> |
   
## Text value

A text value is required. The expected integer values are between 0 and 50.
  
## Remarks

This element is required if the [SuggestionsViewOptions](suggestionsviewoptions.md) element is used. The **GoodThreshold** element also determines what meetings are considered Fair. It the percentage of attendees with conflicts is less than the Good Threshold and higher than 50 percent, the suggested meeting time qualifies as Fair. The Good Threshold plus 50 equals the percentage that defines the Good/Fair threshold.
